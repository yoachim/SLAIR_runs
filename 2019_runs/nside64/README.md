Let's see what happens if we crank the nside up to 64.

nside=64:  
Skipped 0 observations
Flushed 0 observations from queue for being stale
Completed 255435 observations
ran in 82 min = 1.4 hours


nside=32:
Skipped 0 observations
Flushed 3 observations from queue for being stale
Completed 254779 observations
ran in 37 min = 0.6 hours

So, changing the resolution results in a 0.26% change in number of exposures. ~2-3 exposures per night, maybe around 80s.
